## Doubly Linked List

Doubly Linked List is a lightweight, dependency free linked list implementation in TypeScript.

## Setting Up

install with your package manager of choice and import

`import {LinkedList} from 'doublylinkedlist'`

## About

A list contains nodes that each have a data property, since the LinkedList class takes a generic type, the data property for each node will match a given type.

```
const sweetNode = new Node<number>({data: 1})
const sweetList = new LinkedList({head: sweetNode, size: 1})

// is the same as

const sweetNode = new LinkedList<number>()
sweetNode.insertAtHead(1)

```

Each node references a next and previous node via the `next` and `previous` properties (an arrow function that returns the relevant node).

## Usage

new lists can be instantiated with or without existing nodes

```
const niceList = new LinkedList()
```

# Adding Nodes

Nodes can be added to lists at the head, tail, or any given index

```
// new Nodes are created to the list at a given index with given data
niceList.addFirst(1) // list now has one node with data prop of 1
niceList.addLast(3) // list now has two nodes with data props of 1 and 3
niceList.insert(1, 2) // list now has three nodes with data props of 1, 2, and 3
```

# Using Nodes

Nodes can be accessed individually by Index

```
// probably don't do this if the node's index will change
const niceListHead = niceList.at(0)
```

this method can also take a callback for side effects

```
const logNode = node => {
  console.log(node)
  return node
}

niceList.at(0, logNode) // data: 1, next: [Function], previous: [Function]
```

a list can also be iterated over to execute side effects

```
niceList.forEach(logNode) // data: 1, next: [Function], previous: [Function]
// data: 2, next: [Function], previous: [Function]
// data: 3, next: [Function], previous: [Function]
```

# Removing Nodes

Nodes are removed by a given index

```
niceList.remove(1) // list now has 2 nodes with data props of 1 and 3
```

or all at once

```
niceList.clear() // list is empty
```

# Note about node indexing

Some list methods use an index parameter to modify lists or access values. LinkedLists can be thought of as having a zero-based index when using non-negative integers or a 1-based index when using a negative integer

The following is true for lists with nodes:

index 0 references the head
index this.size \* -1 references the head
index -1 also references the tail
index this.size - 1 references the tail
